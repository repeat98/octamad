# Euclid

A stereo Euclidean modulation effect for either FX slot. It follows the
Octatrack transport, track speed and swing grid. A 1–64-step rhythm drives
one of five destinations: 12 dB/octave low-pass, band-pass, high-pass,
notch, or amplitude. The rhythm keeps rolling across pattern loops; PLAY
resets phase.

The `euclid` remix retains the stock Plate, Spring and Dark Reverb rows in
FX2. Their descriptors, DSP code and dispatch entries stay stock.

The `octapitch-euclid` remix adds the same effect to Octapitch2's REPITCH,
PREVIEW VOL and FORCE FILENAME BPM improvements. It removes DJ EQ,
Spring Reverb and Plate Reverb, as requested, and retains every other stock
effect. Euclid is available in both FX slots; Dark Reverb remains in FX2.

FREQ is the base cutoff for LP/BP/HP/NOTCH and the base gain for AMP. DEPTH is
bipolar: its center leaves the destination static, positive values increase
it on a pulse, and negative values decrease it. RES controls the four filter
types and is inert for AMP. MIX zero is exact dry passthrough.

TYPE offers LP, BP, HP, AMP and NOTCH. AMP retains value 3 so existing saved
parts remain compatible; NOTCH is appended at value 4. The filter modes use
the same two-pole TPT state-variable core, with NOTCH summing its low-pass and
high-pass taps. AMP applies the Euclidean control signal as gain, so it can
produce rhythmic level envelopes, gates and stepped/random amplitude. In AMP,
the panel renames FREQ/RES/DEPTH to LEVEL/--/AMT; every filter type restores
the original names.

STEPS displays 1–64; PULSE displays 0–64 and is limited internally to STEPS.
STEPS, PULSE and ROT use the full dial arc without changing stored values or
encoder increments. This uses the remixer's shared `WIDE_STEPPED` formatter
support rather than an effect-owned panel detour.

ROT shifts both the rhythm and captured random values right. RATE offers
1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 relative to track speed; 1/16 is one track
step. A RATE change joins the next point on the new grid without replaying a
backlog.

The output selector names itself ENV, GATE, RAND or LOOP:

- **ENV:** each pulse retriggers an attack and curved decay. ATK ranges from
  immediate to one step. DEC reaches eight steps and may cross several rests.
- **GATE:** each pulse opens the destination for LEN, from 1/128 to one step.
  EDGE smooths both transitions and is limited to half the gate length.
- **RAND:** each pulse chooses and holds a new level. SLEW controls the
  transition, up to one step.
- **LOOP:** freezes the last random value heard at every Euclidean position.
  ROT moves the captured values with the rhythm; returning to RAND resumes
  generation.

Zero pulses and STOP return to the base cutoff or gain. Captured values
survive transport restarts but are runtime state, not project data.

Swing uses the track's swing mask and amount, including Swing All changes.
Rotation and odd Euclidean lengths do not rotate the track swing grid. The
1/32 subdivision interpolates the surrounding track-step offsets.

## Implementation

`control.c` is the integer rhythm/envelope engine. `generate_control.py`
compiles it to the checked-in `control.s` and appends `hooks.s`. The frame
hook publishes the modulated FREQ value after stock scene and LFO processing,
which otherwise overwrites it. Both PLAY paths call one reset routine and
restore the condition codes produced by the displaced stock PLAYING store.

Firmware addresses and sequencer-record strides are named and cited against
`docs/firmware/EXTERNAL.md`. Track scale, length, swing and masks are read
once per track even when Euclid occupies both FX slots. The ColdFire engine
derives only the envelope timing used by the active output mode; stopped and
inactive instances skip it.

`filter.asm` contains the stereo two-pole TPT state-variable core and a
dedicated AMP path. AMP reproduces the original gain arithmetic exactly while
skipping the coefficient lookup, reciprocal divide and stereo filters; on the
host instruction meter it falls from about 2,276 to 462 instructions per
16-sample block. Returning to a filter clears the hidden integrators before
processing. Cutoff ramps per sample. Its reciprocal denominator follows a moving
cutoff to avoid closing-sweep overshoots, but a held cutoff reuses the exact
coefficient instead of paying for a 24-step divide on every sample. All DSP
state is initialized and private to the instance; no audio buffer is
allocated.

## Verification

`make check REMIX=euclid` runs the Euclid suite as part of the normal verify
target. It checks the native control laws, checked-in ColdFire assembly,
executed hook traces, caller registers and PLAY condition codes, both DSP
payloads, LP/BP/HP/NOTCH response, AMP unity/silence and instruction cost,
rapid TYPE changes, cutoff sweeps, stock-row
isolation and the real panel renderer. With `OT_PROJECT` it also boots a
copied project under the ColdFire port and checks full playback. No test
writes to the source project or hardware.

The current revision has not been hardware-tested by these tools.
