# `scenes` — The MIDI SCENES family

MIDI SCENES + the LO-FI AMF fix + CC PAGE 2. Every stock effect stays.

## What is in it

- **MIDI SCENES** (bkkbrls-del, [midisc](https://github.com/bkkbrls-del/midisc) 1.40MIDISC8.2) — per-scene parameter locks driven over MIDI: a second lock table the panel never had; scene hold, XF morph, part save/reload and the scene clear/copy/paste rows read it when a MIDI event is driving. The panel path is untouched. Twelve units in DRAM, 38 detours, 4 pokes inside the OS.
- **LOFI AMF FIX** (Bryan T, [octa-bt-pt](https://github.com/bryantysinger/octa-bt-pt)) — stock LO-FI's AMF knob jumps the pitch backwards at some settings because its coefficient multiply is `mpysu` (signed × unsigned) where both operands are magnitudes; two DSP words become `mpyuu`.
- **CC PAGE 2** (Sam Banks) — MIDI CC 62–67 reach the FX2 effect's page-2 knobs (slots 6–11) and CC 68–73 the FX1 effect's; stock reaches only page 1 over MIDI. One ColdFire cave. Confirmed on hardware 13 Sep 2026.

## Status

Boots under the ColdFire port. Not flashed; MIDI SCENES has run on hardware in `ok-ms`, CC PAGE 2 in the rig.

## Build

```bash
make image REMIX=scenes BUILD=1     # -> out/OCTATRACK_OCTABAM1.bin
```

[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) is the walk-through from a fresh machine to a flashed unit. `make check REMIX=scenes` runs every gate first.
