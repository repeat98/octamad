# `character` — CHARACTER

The station that dirties or tightens a track: fold, saturate, tilt,
compress, width, mix.

On stock LO-FI's id 0x1c, FX1 only: an FX2 instance runs as a dry pass
(`Claims(fx1_only=True)`, `verify_character.py`); the FX2 chooser hides the
row. The chain is fixed: fold → saturate → tilt → compress → width → mix,
distortion before dynamics. The saturation and compressor laws are
JClones' (MIT; TapeHead, DaTube, OInflator, AC1), re-derived here (Sources,
below). Defaults are a bit-exact passthrough (DRV 0, FOLD 0, TONE 64, COMP
0, MIX 127, WDTH 64; KEY SELF, KLVL 64): a part that stored LO-FI runs
this. A part's stored bytes are stock LO-FI's until `ot_project.py
stamp-defaults` writes ours.

## Knobs

| page | slot | name | range | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | DRV | 0–127, default 0 | the saturator's drive (SAT picks the character). DRV 0 skips the stage, bit-exact. Since 23 Sep 2026 (Sam: "much too subtle") DRV also drives the curve's input by G = 1 + 3·DRV/128 (+12 dB at 127), on top of each mode's own law, with the output scaled per mode: TAPE ×1 (TapeHead's trim already holds its small signal at unity and its smoothstep compresses the rest; with 1/G on top a loop sat 18 dB under dry at DRV 127), TUBE ×(1+d)/G, INFL ×1/G |
| 1 | 1 | FOLD | 0–127, default 0 | a wrap-and-reflect wavefolder, 1 → 48× into the fold at a held level; first fold on a pad at ~24 |
| 1 | 2 | WDTH | bipolar, default 64 | mid/side: 64 untouched, 0 mono, 127 double sides. TXTR's slot until 22 Sep 2026 (TXTR removed after a squeal on the unit when it was touched on the master, unreproduced on the harness) |
| 1 | 3 | COMP | 0–127, default 0 | JClones AC1's console channel law: `Lv = K × level`; `gr = (Lv²/2 − 1)² + a·Lv` clamped at 1 — a dip around Lv = 1 whose depth is `a = 0.75 − 0.675·COMP/128`; makeup `1 / (1 − 0.3375·COMP/128)`. GLUE (slow, soft-kneed; 0.5 / 500 ms, K = 3) on the master BY POSITION, COMP (fast; 0.5 / 63 ms, K = 4; the release coefficient is 3024/2^23, written as 50 ms until 21 Sep 2026) on every other track; no knob for the choice. One feedforward detector on the mono key, the gain applied to both channels. COMP 0 skips the stage bit-exactly |
| 1 | 4 | TONE | bipolar, default 64 | a tilt after the saturator in every mode, drawn −64..+63: 0 flat and bit-exact, + bright, − dark: +3.5 dB above / −6 dB below the 1.2 kHz pivot at 127, the mirror at 0. It was RET, the bus return level, from 13 to 20 Sep 2026 (on T8 by dispatch position the last live engine's wet entered at the front of the chain and the hosts were stamped quiet; degraded on the unit, clean under the port, `docs/contributing/FAILURE_MODES.md`, removed) |
| 1 | 5 | MIX | 0–127, default 127 | out = x + MIX·(w − x); MIX 127 is 127/128 |
| 2 | 6 | SAT | TAPE / TUBE / INFL | TAPE = TapeHead: a state-variable split at TONE, the low and band parts through a cubic smoothstep, the top clean; drive 0.8× → 8× from a 17-word P table. TUBE = DaTube: u − u^P with the negative half driven twice as hard, level-compensated (a per-block division); the curve is a 17-pair P table. INFL = OInflator: a signed cubic, DRV is its Effect |
| 2 | 7 | KEY | SELF / T1 | the compressor's key (29 Sep 2026). SELF: the track's own mono input, per sample. T1: the BusDelay host's peak \|mono in\| of T1 per block (`y:$990`, the bus scratch), × KLVL/64, held across the block into the same attack / release smoother. The host also counts its calls at `y:$991`; a count that has not moved for 4 blocks reads as silence (no delay host in the remix, or boot garbage). On the master (T8) KEY is ignored: T8 receives T1 in its input, so a T1 key there would duck T1 too. A KEY byte other than 1 reads as SELF |
| 2 | 8 | KLVL | 0–127, default 64 | scales T1's key level, 64 = unity |

## Measured

- DRV drive (23 Sep 2026): THD on a 1 kHz tone at −20 dBFS (the set's
  working level), before → after: TAPE DRV 64 −40 → −23 dB, DRV 127
  −18 → −11 dB; TUBE 127 −22 → −18 dB; INFL 127 −58 → −37 dB. Level on that
  tone at DRV 64 / 127: TAPE +7.3 / +1.1 dB, TUBE +2.1 / +1.4, INFL +1.8 /
  +3.1; on the test loop's peaks TAPE +1.7 / −6.7, TUBE +0.5 / −4.2, INFL
  +1.2 / −0.1. Small-signal gain at DRV 127: +12 / +6 / 0 dB by mode
  (`verify_character`).
- The ports (13 Sep 2026, image 98 build): TAPE / TUBE / INFL matched their
  float references to ≤ 7e-3 / 2e-3 / 1.4e-3 (TAPE 2e-2 on noise at DRV 127,
  the drive table's interpolation); TONE's `k2` linear in TONE, 0.5 % from
  the sine. GLUE / COMP on AC1's law; COMP 40 = +0.96 dB.
- KEY (29 Sep 2026), `tools/verify/verify_charkey.py` (both cores, the
  delay host on T1): a burst at 0.25 over a 0.05 tone ducks T3 (core 1) and
  T6 (core 0) by 9.2 dB at KEY = T1, COMP 127, KLVL 64, lock-step and under
  skews 1 / 37 / 333 / −250; SELF ducks 8.7 dB on the same burst. With the
  host silent or absent, KEY = T1 holds 0.00 dB. SELF is bit-identical with
  the host fed or silent; T8 at KEY = T1 is bit-identical with SELF; the
  host's output is bit-identical with and without Characters reading it.
  `make verify-ident MOD=character` against the build before it: 9 of 9
  settings bit-identical with KEY = SELF (the matrix's `max` case sets
  KEY = T1 and differs by design).
- Cost with KEY: 938 words on each payload (881 before), 244 cycles per
  sample by the pricer (241 before).
- `tools/verify/verify_character.py`: defaults bit-exact; MIX=0 bit-exact
  with every stage driven; every SAT character unity small-signal at DRV=0
  and bounded at DRV=127; FOLD folds a monotonic ramp; COMP reduces the loud
  signal 6.1 dB more than the quiet one and is exactly unity at 0; WDTH 0 is
  mono and 64 exact; an FX2 instance is a bit-exact dry pass.
- The threshold/ratio numbers that once stood for COMP (thr 0.03, invR 0.1,
  8/100 ms) were the retired law's.
- Cost history (current above): 888 words on each payload (903 after the DRV drive, 790 before it;
  671 before the pointer rewrite; 975 with TXTR; 1,138 / 1,195 with the
  return, 20 Sep 2026); pricer per mode (`cycle_count.py --modes`, words):
  TAPE 325, TUBE 321, INFL 245 (354 / 339 / 268 after the DRV drive, 23
  Sep 2026).
- 23 Sep 2026: the loop's state pointers go through n3 alone (TapeHead's
  states at `$3e..$41`, TUBE's DC blockers at `$42..$45`, the tilt block at
  r4 + n3); COMP reads its key from the frame instead of a per-sample
  store; the tilt's k, TapeHead's 0.7 and TUBE's R load once per sample or
  ride in the ring; twelve parallel moves (forms with stock precedent);
  OInflator inlined per channel. Bit-identical on `make verify-ident
  MOD=character` (9 settings) and a T8 (GLUE) rig render.
- 22 Sep 2026: the sample loop reads its coefficients through two 16-word
  post-increment rings and its state through pointers; displaced `(r7+$..)`
  moves per sample path went TAPE 79 / TUBE 74 / INFL 62 -> 0. Probe 57
  (`docs/firmware/CHIP.md` section 2) timed a one-word displaced move at 3.98 cycles
  against 2.00 for a pointer or register move in a one-instruction DO loop,
  so the words the pricer counts understate the chip's cost of the old form.
  Nine renders (three modes x two knob sets, DRV 0 with FOLD, T8 GLUE, T8
  TUBE) are bit-identical to the pre-rewrite build.
- `verify_menu`, `verify_replaces` (it took LO-FI's FX1 page) and
  `verify_labels` (the select prints its words on the emulated firmware)
  pass on the rig.

## On the unit

- On Sam's unit since flash 4; the return confirmed on flash 7; the master
  shape (Character everywhere, RET by position, wet in front) flashed 13 Sep
  2026 as image 96; the return removed 20 Sep 2026.
- ✅ Image 8: COMP 40 / 80 / 127 keep both channels within 0.6 dB of each
  other on the master.
- ✅ TAPE's drive law voiced live: unity plus a gentle lift ("drv sounds
  great"), 14 Sep 2026, before the 23 Sep DRV drive.
- KEY (29 Sep 2026): not flashed.

## Open

- KEY's latency across cores: not measured under the port.
- LMC1 COMP (a feedback console comp) was built on 13 Sep 2026, +125 words
  over, and kept as a draft.

## Sources

The laws, from [JClones/JSFXClones](https://github.com/JClones/JSFXClones)
(MIT); licences in `THIRD_PARTY.md`:

| stage | source | the law |
|---|---|---|
| TAPE | TapeHead | Chamberlin SVF at 2.1 / 3.7 / 5 kHz; `ss(v) = 1.5v − 0.5v³` clipped ±1 on the LP and BP bands, the HP band passed at −1.157; drive 0.8x..8x = `0.8·10^((D−1)/9)`; trim 0.7. Here TONE (page-1 slot 4) sweeps the split 2.1→5 kHz |
| TUBE | DaTube | `x *= drive+0.5`; `y = x + (d/2)((1−x) − (1−x)^P)` for x>0, `x + d((1+x)^P − (1+x))` for x<0, P = ln10+1; 3 Hz DC remover. Here one table `T(u) = u − u^P`, the sign selects d/2 vs d |
| INFL | OInflator | `x *= 0.5`; `gr = clamp(2c·\|x\| + (1−c))`, `y = (1 − \|gr·x\|)(gr·x)·2e + (1−e)x`; ×2. No table, no division; Effect on DRV |
| GLUE / COMP | AC1 | level = \|x\| smoothed 0.5 ms / 500 ms; `gr = (Lv²/2 − 1)² + Lv·a`, `a = 0.75 − (Comp−1)·0.075`, clamp ≤ 1; a polynomial gain per sample, no table |
| (draft) COMP | LMC1 | feedback console comp: sidechain HP 340 Hz → LP 4 kHz → ×gr → square → 2.5 / 25 ms smoother → √; hard knee, `gr = (L/thr)^−3.077` (≈4:1), −40 dB floor; ported as the power per block: one division + a 33-entry table of r^−1.538 |

FUZZ (SAT's third slot before INFL) and TRNS were retired 13 Sep 2026.
Not ported: TubeDriver (`t/(t+bias)`, a division per sample); the full
SatBuss (13 one-poles and a feedback mesh); a reduced SatBuss (the √2
squarer + the rational soft clip as a table + an 8 Hz DC block) would keep
its harmonic signature without the bloom.
