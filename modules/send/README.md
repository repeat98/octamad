# `send` — SEND

The bus client, and the architecture record of the cross-core aux bus it
feeds: the sends, the rotating accumulators, the auto-gain, the chain from
the delay into the reverb.

Two knobs: DEL, this track's level into the delay, and REV, its level into
the reverb. The reverb also hears the delay's repeats × its DLY knob; each
engine's wet comes out on the track that hosts it (BusDelay on T1,
[`busdelay`](../busdelay/README.md); BusVerb on T5,
[`busverb`](../busverb/README.md)). SEND taps the audio buffer and never
writes it, so a SEND at DEL 0 and REV 0 is indistinguishable from no
effect. A fresh, unassigned track (FX2 id 0) is aliased to it rather than
to NONE because SEND does the per-block bus housekeeping, so no track can
stall the bus. It is also the fallback: an id a bus-carrying remix does not
implement resolves here. The development logs, `XBUS_LOG.md` (the
cross-core race) and `BUS.md` (the per-bank two-bus design this replaced,
and the one-aux build of 7 Sep 2026), are in git history under
`docs/history/` (`git show 3ceba41:docs/history/<name>`); the dated record

## Knobs

| page | slot | name | reads | range | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | DEL | `x:(r6+0)` | 0–127, default 0 | this track's level into the aux accumulator `Y:0x901..0x980`, the delay's only input |
| 1 | 1 | REV | `x:(r6+1)` | 0–127, default 0 | this track's level into the REV accumulator `Y:0xa58..0xad7` (spelled `$9d8 + $80`), the reverb's |

Each knob registers its send in its own per-buffer count (`0x9c7..0x9ce`
aux, `0x983..0x98a` REV) only while it is nonzero. Driving the wrong knob
renders silence. One knob into a delay-then-reverb chain from 6 to 25 Sep
2026; under the two-bus layout (until 7 Sep 2026) the two knobs were
`x:(r6+0)` →DELAY and `x:(r6+1)` →REVERB.

The slots across the bus (stamp every project before play,
`tools/hw/ot_project.py stamp-defaults <project> <remix> --all`; without
`--all` the stamper touches only the ids a station replaced):

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEND | DEL | REV | | | | | | | | | | |
| BusVerb | DEL | REV | SIZE | SHMR | SHFT | WET | MODE | TONE | DIFF | GATE | DLY | TIME |
| BusDelay | DEL | REV | FDBK | TONE | PING | WET | MODE | SCTR | DENS | SIZE | PTCH | TIME |

Since 26 Sep 2026 the hosts carry SEND's two knobs on slots 0/1 and draw
nothing else on their pages (the remix's `host_slots`); every other engine
knob is on the TEMPO window. T1's DEL feeds the delay and its REV the
reverb's REV accumulator; T5's DEL feeds the delay's aux and its REV the
reverb. TIME moved to page-2 slot 11 (`$e` bits 8-15) on both; WOW left
BusDelay. A part saved before reads its old TIME byte as REV and its old
slot-11 byte (WOW, or 0) as TIME: stamp before play (`stamp-defaults
<project> bottleservice --all --keep-mode`).

## Measured

- Carried by every flashed bus image (`CHANGELOG.md`); the two-knob form
  (DEL and REV, 25 Sep 2026) by image 88 on Sam's MKII (27 Sep 2026). The
  auto-gain numbers are `dsp_host` measurements; the T8 refusal and the
  FX1-NONE return were measured under the ColdFire port.
- ✅ Payload A / core 0 serves tracks 5–8, payload B / core 1 tracks 1–4
  (marker flash, 10 Aug 2026).
- ✅ P, X and Y alias in the shared window; the stock allocator's slot
  table (`X:0x255`, both payloads of the raw image) hands the low half to
  core 0 and the high half to core 1 (`docs/firmware/DSP.md` section 7).
- Total bus latency is 3 blocks since 22 Sep 2026: 48 samples on hardware,
  45 in the harness's 15-frame blocks (2 blocks from 17 Aug to 21 Sep;
  `docs/history/TESTPASS.md`).
- Auto-gain (below): a quiet sender turns the loud sender's reverb down:
  three senders, two of them 10–15 dB quieter, measured 4.8 dB below the
  loud sender alone (`docs/history/CAPTURE_18AUG.md` capture E, against
  1/N's predicted −9.5). A client that registers and contributes nothing
  dilutes every real sender by √(N/(N+1)): −3.0 dB with one sender (the
  −6.02 dB measured on 17 Aug 2026 was under 1/N). A track already sending
  loses 3 dB of wet each time the sender count doubles (1→2, 2→4, 4→8),
  stepped per block when a knob leaves 0; N counts knobs, not signal, per
  bus. The "1 through 7 senders render identically" measurement fed the
  same tone to every sender, the one case where 1/N and 1/√N agree.
- 🟡 An FX1 slot runs SEND (id 0 is aliased to SEND and the FX1 chooser's
  NONE is id 0). Under the port on Sam's project (bank 1, T1/T5/T6/T8 FX1
  = NONE; `--dsp-pcwatch` on the tracker's store), core 1 ran the SEND
  client eight times a frame, at 0x6100 0x6200 0x6400 0x6500 0x6700 0x6800
  0x6a00 0x6b00 in that order: the FX1 slots are
  0x6100/0x6400/0x6700/0x6a00, the FX2 slots 0x6200/0x6500/0x6800/0x6b00
  (three r7 bumps per track). The port's flip lands late in core 1's frame
  (between 0x6800 and 0x6a00 in every frame watched).
- Return balance on material (7 Sep 2026, `out/rig/oneaux/`, the
  MIX-crossfade stage of the time; WET adds since 15 Sep 2026 and the wet
  is ×2 since 16 Sep): drum loop −25.1 dB rms with the reverb at MIX 0 and
  −26.8 at MIX 127; pad −31.4 / −32.8; no makeup. (The "wet ~25 dB under
  the repeats" reading from the 438 Hz gate tone was retracted the same
  day.)
- Residual at 6–7 senders: 2 samples in 16,305 differ by ≤ 33 LSB
  (−105 dB) from the lag-0 control; does not scale with amplitude; filed as
  rounding under the added latency.

## On the unit

- ✅ Flash 7 (OCTABAM21): the one aux bus, the delay feeding the reverb,
  the T8 return of the time, every one-aux claim.
- ✅ Image 47 (a marker tone whenever a client's last stamp was gone)
  sounded on every block of plain play: core 1's tracker one step ahead.
  Image 48: SEND returns at proc entry on an FX1 r7. Image 49: the eight
  buffers and the per-client count.
- ✅ The three cross-core defects (below) closed on the unit, sweep of
  core-1 tracks × delay modes.
- Image 88 (27 Sep 2026, Sam's MKII): the two-knob SEND.

## Open

- 🟡 The race fix assumes the cores are rate-locked (same sample clock,
  constant phase offset); drift would show as a slow return of the
  artifact over minutes.
- The artifacts relocate: one (core-1 track, delay mode) pairing is bad at
  a time and moves with the mode or core 0's load; any "fixed" claim needs
  a track × mode sweep.
- 🟡 That the 0x6100 FX1 call caused core 1's permanent lead of one is
  inferred from the call order and the flip phase, which nothing local can
  see. What would falsify it: image 48 still washing on a THRU host past
  position 0 with a trig on every step, or still bleeding with every SEND
  at 0.

## Gates

- The manifest's gate: `tools/verify/verify_burn.py`.
- `make verify-bus`: 19 layouts (17 until 18 Aug 2026; the two `IN` cases
  were added after the delay's IN decode was deleted by a splice with 17/17
  still passing), the three carriers of the housekeeping block, the
  election, 1–7 senders per bus, both cross-sends, split blocks, compared
  bit-for-bit against a stamp (`SAVE=1` first).
- `tools/verify/verify_onebus.py` (in `make check`) runs the chain on both
  cores: T5 prints the reverb (stereo) and T1 the delay; the reverb hears
  the delay; delay WET 0 == no delay three blocks later, sample-exact; a
  host at WET 0 prints only its dry; T1's print is bit-identical with the
  reverb at WET 0, WET 127 or absent; a SEND at core-0 position 3 (T8) at
  SEND 127 changes neither host and the mirror position on core 1 does; a
  Character with slot 4 stored 127 (RET in a pre-20-Sep part) prints
  nothing and changes neither host; a station with stored send bytes
  contributes nothing; T5's DEL and T1's REV land bit-identically to a SEND
  track's on the same core; the chain is identical under four
  instruction-level skews.
- `make verify-twocore`: SEND, delay and series hops on their real cores ==
  the DEV hatch.
- `dsp_host` runs both cores since 7 Sep 2026, lock-step or under `-skew`;
  a mismatch under skew is a defect, identity is not evidence
  (`tools/harness/README.md`). The decisive configuration is BusDelay on
  track 1, fed over the bus.

## The shape

```
every track ──SEND──▶ [aux accumulator] ──▶ BusDelay (T1 FX2) ──chain──▶ BusVerb (T5 FX2)
  (DEL; the hosts' too)   [REV accumulator] ─────────────────────────────▶ (REV)
                                            stage 1: T1 prints           stage 2: T5 prints
                                            dry + wet × WET              dry + wet × WET

CORE 0 (payload A)  tracks 5–8   BusVerb   Y:0x4000–0xBFFF (private) + Y:0x30000–0x37FFF (shared lo) = 65,536 words = 1.49 s
CORE 1 (payload B)  tracks 1–4   BusDelay  Y:0x4000–0xBFFF (private) + Y:0x38000–0x3FFFF (shared hi) = 65,536 words = 1.49 s
```

- Each engine runs on its core's position 0 only (`Remix.locked`, image
  51, 22 Sep 2026) — the reverb on T5, the delay on T1 — and is an exact
  dry pass on any other track (the HOSTGUARD body at proc entry: `r7 ==
  0x6200`); `stamp-defaults` warns about an engine anywhere else. Image 52
  takes both engines out of the FX2 chooser (SEND is its only row) and
  RIG HOSTS gives every new project T1 = BusDelay, T5 = BusVerb from the
  part-defaults initialiser. Until 22 Sep 2026 the reverb ran on any of
  T5–8 and the delay on any of T1–4.
- Under `SPEC=1` each server exists in one payload and can only be hosted
  on its own core's bank; any track can send into it. The absent server's
  dispatch id is aliased to the SEND client on the other payload, so a
  wrong menu pick runs a send.
- A server's memory is its core's two private FX2 slots plus half of the
  64K shared window `0x30000–0x3FFFF`.
- Each engine carries SEND's knobs at slots 0/1: T1's DEL goes into the
  delay, T5's REV into the reverb (flagged at `0x981`, counted on the REV
  bus). Stations carry no sends. The housekeeper clears both accumulators
  and both counts together.
- The chain: the delay stamps `Y:0x9c3` every block it runs (after its
  warm-up); the reverb reads it, clear-on-read, one writer one reader,
  three blocks of grace. The delay writes `wet × DLY`, mono, into the chain
  buffer `Y:0x9d8..0xa57` (eight rotations × 16 words, stored, never
  cleared). The reverb's input is the REV accumulator × 1/√N plus the chain
  × 1/8 (the loop's `asl #3` lands the chain word untouched) while the
  delay is live, × 0 otherwise. DLY is the reverb's page-2 slot 10; the
  reverb publishes its knob field to `Y:0x982` every block (one writer,
  like `0x981`) and the delay glides it as it glides WET. Until 25 Sep 2026
  the chain carried `in + wet × DLY` (the send passing through the delay at
  unity) and the reverb read the chain or, with no delay, the aux.
- So: a DEL-only send reaches the reverb only as repeats × DLY; a REV-only
  send never reaches the delay; DLY 0 = the two engines in parallel
  (`verify_onebus` measures each, bit for bit where it can).
- WET on each engine (slot 5): each host prints `wet × WET` under its own
  dry: T1 the repeats, T5 the tail. Until 15 Sep 2026 each stage
  crossfaded (`in × (1 − MIX) + wet × MIX`).
- The wet comes out on the hosts only (20 Sep 2026). The hosts add the wet
  in place after their own send tap, so a host never sends its own wet. From
  7 to 20 Sep 2026 each stage also published its output stereo, four deep
  (`0x9da` reverb, `0xa5a` delay), and Character's `RET` on track 8 (by
  dispatch position, payload A position 3, `r7 $6a00`) returned the last
  live stage's output with both hosts stamped quiet (`0x9d8/0x9d9`); on
  image 35 that return was "less rich / bit-crushed" on the unit and clean
  under the port (`docs/contributing/FAILURE_MODES.md`), and the mechanism
  went.
- The send is refused on track 8: SEND at core 0's position 3 (`r7 $6b00`
  on payload A) contributes and registers nothing. T8 is the master: with
  MASTER TRACK on its input is the mix, the hosts' wet included, and a send
  from it would put that wet back into the bus (the master loop that
  silenced the unit on 6 Sep 2026, `docs/contributing/FAILURE_MODES.md`).
  Payload B's position 3 (T4) sends normally; the payload is told apart by
  SEND's `$30000` base literal, rewritten to `$38000` on B (`YBase.XBUS`).

## What a send is

A block with a trig on the track is dispatched as two calls: a=0 for the
frames before the trig (`r0 = 0`, `n7 = split`) and a=1 for the rest
(`r0 = 2 x split`, `n7 = 16 - split`); an unsplit block is one a=1 call
at `r0 = 0`. Every bus participant takes its frame offset from `r0`
(21 Sep 2026); until then the first call stashed a flag and the split in
its block for the second, which is the suspected cause of the trig-host
wash (`docs/contributing/FAILURE_MODES.md`).

A track on SEND runs a client that, each block, adds its level-scaled
audio into the current write accumulator and registers in the client
count. Servers consume the summed previous block.

## The auto-gain

Every writer contributes with 3 bits of headroom (`asr #3`; eight
full-scale clients sum to 1.0) and registers in the per-block count; the
server multiplies the sum by 1/√N of its own registered clients from a
reciprocal table and shifts back, so eight senders drive a server as hard
as one. The law was 1/N until 17 Aug 2026 (R27): uncorrelated tracks sum as
√N, so 1/N over-corrected by 3 dB per doubling (`modules/busverb/
reverb_server.asm` "THE LAW IS 1/sqrt(N)"). Registration is gated on the
send knob, because a client that registers and contributes nothing dilutes
everyone. Every writer registers, the cross-core one included.

## The accumulators: eight rotating buffers

Since 22 Sep 2026 (four from 17 Aug) the bus keeps eight accumulator
buffers and eight chain buffers, rotated once per block; a server reads
three buffers back from the write, and the housekeeper clears the buffer
two on from the one it flips to:

- A buffer is written at block n, read at n+3, cleared at n+6. A client
  whose label is one off in either direction writes n±1: never the buffer
  being cleared (n+2), never one being read (n−3..n−1); a reader one off
  reads n−4..n−2, never one being written. The margin is a whole block on
  each side, so no cross-core phase can tear a buffer.
- Eight because the count is a power of two: rotation `+16 & $70`, read
  offset `+80 & $70` (five on == three back), clear target `+32 & $70`; the
  mask sanitises boot garbage.
- Read-three-back costs a third block of latency (48 samples, 1.1 ms;
  the chain adds three more through a live delay).
- Both directions ride the same rotation (core 1 reading core 0's clears;
  core 1 writing into core 0's accumulator).

Bus scratch, `Y:0x900..` in core 0's half of the shared window
(`send_client.asm` is the map): `0x900` rotation, `0x901..0x980` aux
accumulator, `0x981` BusVerb host's SEND field, `0x9c1/0x9c2` role locks,
`0x9c3` the delay's liveness stamp, `0x9c7..0x9ce` aux send count per
buffer, `0x9d8..0xa57` the chain buffer. Role locks make the first instance
of a server the only one: a second instance returns as a passthrough, so a
server's cycle cost is charged once per bank.

## Housekeeping and the rotation

Housekeeping (flip the rotation, clear buffers) is gated to payload A;
every bus participant carries the block, and an election makes the
first-dispatched core-0 instance (position 0 = track 5) run it.

- Core 0's clients read the rotation after their own housekeeper flipped
  it. Core 1's clients never label a block from it: each counts its own
  blocks from a seed read at init and, once a block, checks the count
  against the rotation R (`build_bus.py` ROTLATCH, 22 Sep 2026). A
  difference of one either way is kept (the seed was read before or after
  a flip); two or more means lost blocks or boot garbage, and the count
  snaps to R. A count cannot flap with the flip's phase, and a label one
  off in either direction is inside the eight buffers' margin.
- Before it (9 to 21 Sep 2026) one tracker per core followed R, advancing
  at position 0 and keeping `T == R + 1` as the pre-flip phase, which could
  not tell a genuine lead of one from it; images 40–47's washes were that
  lead. A label from two shared words (the rotation and a word every core-0
  client stores at the end of its proc) was tried first on 22 Sep 2026: the
  pair reads the same before a block's flip and after its last client, so a
  late reader labels one ahead; the port's two-core gate showed it (four
  layouts differing from the one-core control).

## An FX1 slot is not a client

SEND's proc runs on every FX1 slot set to NONE, at that slot's r7. On
images up to 47 that had two consequences:

- The FX1 call registered and sent from whatever byte its page held: the
  bleed into the bus with every SEND at 0 (image 46, on the unit). The
  stamper zeroed id-0 slots from 16 Sep 2026 to hide it.
- On core 1 the 0x6100 call ran the tracker's compare before position 0's
  advance. With the flip landing before that call, it snapped T to R, the
  0x6200 call then advanced to R + 1, and every later check read
  `T == R + 1` as the legitimate pre-flip phase: one step ahead for good,
  which is the buffer core 0 clears. The port never shows it (its flip
  lands late, so 0x6100 always compared equal).

Since image 48 SEND returns at once on an FX1 r7 (0x6100/0x6400/0x6700/
0x6a00; four compares at proc entry, before any state is touched): no
registration, no write, no tracker call. Image 49's per-client count needs
no advance and no position, so T1's FX2 may be anything. Images 44–46
carried a self-check instead (a stamp per client per buffer, a hold flag,
position 0 skipping one advance): 44 and 45 wedged on the first play (a
never-run displaced Y store, then an unmasked slot read into a wild Y
address), 46 played with static and the wash. Removed in 48; the tracker
body is image 43's.

## The three cross-core defects

Each found on hardware, each visible only once the previous one was fixed;
all three closed on the unit:

| # | defect | fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | clear-vs-read: core 0 zeroing a buffer core 1 was still reading; +18 to +31 dB of broadband hash on the bus path | four buffers, read two back |
| 2 | the rotation read: each client read the shared rotation at its own dispatch time; block-rate amplitude jitter | per-core rotation tracking |
| 3 | clear-vs-write: core 0's clear racing core 1's writers | clear the next-block buffer |

Plus the unseeded rotation tracking above. The diagnostic that isolated
them: change what runs on track 5 (the housekeeper), which moves the flip
in time and nothing else.

## The shared window

| range | what | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `0x30000–0x30047` | stock's per-frame parameter staging ✅ | rewritten every frame |
| `0x30000–0x37FFF` | core 0's half: BusVerb's relocated buffers (`0x30000`, `0x34000`), shimmer line, tank state | fully owned |
| `0x31000` / `0x32000` | stock bootstraps A and B ✅ | dead after boot |
| `0x36000+` | bus scratch (`docs/firmware/CHIP.md` for the extent) | both cores touch it |
| `0x38000–0x3FFFF` | core 1's half: BusDelay's LineL, 32,768 words (LineR is core 1's private `Y:0x4000–0xBFFF`, 15 Sep 2026) | 741 ms per line |

AGU modulo addressing needs power-of-2 alignment (big buffers at
`0x30000`/`0x34000`/`0x38000`/`0x3C000`); `0xC000–0x2FFFF` is absent, so no
single 128K buffer; the DSP56720 manual guarantees no bus contention while
the cores touch different 8K blocks ✅. A delay line based in core 0's half
sweeps the rotation word, the accumulators and the role locks every 16,384
samples (12 Aug 2026).

## Program space

`SPEC=1`: each payload carries SEND plus its own server, so the donor region
(2,724 words per core for the DEFAULT harvest, the three stock FX2 reverb
slots; since 3 Sep 2026 any of the thirteen, up to 6,158) is spent once per
effect. `SPEC=1` requires `XBUS=1`: without the bus each half of the tracks
reaches only its own core's server, and the build still makes sound, so the
build guards the combination. The build report is the free-word ledger
(`make bus`).

## Who uses what on the bus (Y memory)

| | |
|---|---|
| BusVerb | `Y:0x4000–0xBFFF`, 32,768 words, hardcoded, both payloads (different cores) |
| BusDelay | LineL `Y:0x38000–0x3FFFF` + LineR `Y:0x4000–0xBFFF` on core 1 ([`busdelay`](../busdelay/README.md) "Memory") |
| bus scratch | `Y:0x900–0xad9`, 474 words; `send_client.asm` is the authoritative map (❌ `0x900–0x980`, "parity word", 4 wet buffers until 30 Aug 2026) |
| per-instance base stash | `Y:0x795 + (r7>>8)`, one word per instance |
| SEND | nothing; never touches its own slot |

32,768 words of shared window is the ceiling per server; BusVerb is at it,
and BusDelay adds the private region on its core. The Y map per core is
`docs/firmware/CHIP.md` section 3.
