# `octakit` — Octakit alone

One module. Her runtime, writes and append rebuild byte-identical to the identities her recipe pins.

## What is in it

- **OCTAKIT** (Em, [ems-octakit](https://github.com/emuyia/ems-octakit) ot-26914) — 256 Kits per Project in place of 64 bank-tied Parts. MKII: PART opens LOAD KIT, FUNC+PART opens SAVE KIT; MKI: FUNC+MIDI opens LOAD KIT, FUNC+BANK opens SAVE KIT. FUNC+CUE reloads the assigned Kit; Kits have 7-character names; the LOAD/SAVE KIT menus copy/paste/clear/undo, LOAD KIT > UNDO KIT reloads the last loaded Kit; FUNC+PASTE+PART (MKI: FUNC+PASTE+MIDI) on a pasted Pattern also saves its Kit to the next free slot; PTN+FUNC+RIGHT saves the current Kit, copies it and the Pattern to the next free slots and loads the pair; PTN+FUNC+TRIG copies/pastes/clears/undoes inactive Patterns (BANK+TRIG, then BANK+FUNC+TRIG for other Banks). Costs 3.6 % of the flex pool (18.4 s at 16-bit). Old projects migrate their Parts into the first 64 Kit slots on load. A 154,718-byte runtime in DRAM, carried by octabam's loader.

## Status

`tools/verify/verify_octakit.py` reproduces her own combined OS image from stock + her writes + her append. Not flashed alone; on hardware in `ok-ms`.

## Build

```bash
make image REMIX=octakit BUILD=1     # -> out/OCTATRACK_OCTABAM1.bin
```

[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) is the walk-through from a fresh machine to a flashed unit. `make check REMIX=octakit` runs every gate first.

## Before you flash

- **Octakit migrates Parts into Kits on project load.** Back up projects first; going back to stock can lose Kit data.
