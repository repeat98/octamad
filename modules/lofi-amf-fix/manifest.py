"""LOFI AMF FIX -- stock LO-FI's AMF coefficient multiply is `mpysu x0,y0,a`
(signed x unsigned) on two magnitudes; the fix is `mpyuu`. Ported from
bryantysinger/octa-bt-pt (his report: "LO-FI's AMF knob jumps the pitch
backward at certain values"). The rest of that tool generates per-user
parameter defaults and is not ported.

Measured here: both words disassembled against the stock image --

    001bef: mpysu   x0,y0,a   ; 01278d   (stock, both payloads)
    001bef: mpyuu   x0,y0,a   ; 0127cd   (the fix)

at P:0x01bef (payload A) / P:0x019af (payload B), resolved to file offsets
with tools/build/dsp_modmap.py. Upstream's 128x128 AMF x Fine sweep (zero
monotonicity violations after the fix) is not reproduced here.

Two pokes on existing stock bytes, so this is `CavePatch.emit` returning
pokes, not a cave. If a remix ever harvested LO-FI's code, each poke's
`expect` refuses the build.
