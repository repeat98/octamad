# The stock DELAY: a ColdFire routine over SDRAM rings

OS 1.40C. The Echo Freeze DELAY (FX2 id `0x08`) does not run on the DSP.
Its DSP dispatch is a passthrough; the audio goes to the ColdFire in the
post-FX2 read-back (`DSP.md` §6c), a per-frame routine at `0x400031a0`
runs all eight tracks over per-track rings in SDRAM, and the result comes
back to core 0 at `X:0x4400`. The DSP side of that ruling is `DSP.md`
"The stock DELAY" (reachability, the id-8 substitution on hardware).

## 1. The routine (Bryan T, `octatrack-delay-architecture.md`, 30 Aug 2026) 🟡

| | |
|---|---|
| frame routine | `0x400031a0..0x4000385a` (`rts` at `0x40003858` ✅ 23 Sep 2026; "to ~`0x40003900`" until then) |
| ring base | SDRAM `0x4F502C10` (cached alias `0x477...`, `PLACEMENT.md`) |
| ring size | 1,411,200 bytes per track = 176,400 × 8 = 4 s × stereo × 4 bytes; stride 1,411,328 ✅ (`0x400037aa`–`b6`) |
| 4-second cap | `if (samples > 176400) samples = 176400` |
| read head | `read_pos = write_pos − delay_samples × 8`, wrapping at the ring size |
| DMA | `0xfc045040/50/60/70`, count/control `0xfc04505e/7e` |
| tap processing | EMAC loop `0x40003664`; two cascaded first-order sections, coefficients per track via `0x80006180` |
| mix and feedback | EMAC loop `0x40003734`; four gains, each linearly ramped across the frame |

No fractional-delay interpolation: whole 8-byte frames, time changes as a
two-tap crossfade between this frame's and last frame's positions (TAPE
off snaps, TAPE on glides). No recursive feedback code: the ring's write
stream contains a scaled copy of its filtered read stream. Eight tracks
sustain 4-second delays because each has its own ring in CPU SDRAM.

❌ Retracted 30 Aug 2026 on his write-up: "the ColdFire does no per-sample audio arithmetic"
(verified only for the audio ISR `0x4000aad0`). The staged delay-time
word `0x80005fa0` is written by the routine itself at `0x40003284..88`
from the staged record `0x80001a00 + 96·snapshot + 12·track` (✅ 31 Aug
2026; ❌ "96·track" until 22 Sep 2026, §2). Open: the gain-to-knob mapping
in the EMAC block; the units of the staged word.

## 2. The frame, the snapshots and the track loop ✅ objdump (22 Sep 2026)

Re-read with `scripts/disasm.sh emac` against Jannik Aßfalg's note (§3):

- Entry `0x400031a0`: `lea -148(%sp)`, `movem.l d2-d7/a2-fp`, the EMAC
  state (MACSR, ACCEXT01/23, acc0-3, MASK) saved at `sp+116`, then
  `MACSR = 0xa0`. The whole routine runs inside that save/restore.
- `0x400031ca`: `d4 = [0x80004804]`, the control-snapshot selector, four
  values (`addq #1` at `0x4000382c` after the track loop, `moveq #3`
  mask). `0x400031d0`: the ping `[0x800000e0]` into `sp+44`.
- Per-snapshot bases from `d4`: setup `a2 = 0x80001b80 + 64·slot + 7`
  (`lsl #6`, `addal #0x80001b87`), byte 7 the FX2 id, compared with 8 at
  `0x40003234`; knobs `d3 = 0x80001a00 + 96·slot` (`lsl #7 − lsl #5`).
  `sp+108 = 0x80000eb4 + 8·ping` (+ track), compared with 7 at
  `0x4000323c`.
- Track loop tail `0x400037e0`–`0x40003822`: `sp+112` counts 0..7; per
  track `sp+72 += 12` (knobs), `sp+76 += 8` and `sp+92 += 8` (setup),
  `sp+80/84/100/104 += 68` (state records), `sp+96 += d5` (audio),
  `sp+108 += 1`. So the routine walks all eight tracks every frame, and
  §1's open "whether tracks 5–8 share the function" is closed.

The frame slots a hook sees:

| `sp+` | holds |
|---|---|
| 44 | ping |
| 48 | ring write pointer (bytes) |
| 72 | six staged page-1 control halfwords, `0x80001a00 + 96·snapshot + 12·track` |
| 76, 92 | eight setup bytes, `0x80001b80 + 64·snapshot + 8·track`; byte 7 = FX2 id |
| 80, 84, 100, 104 | per-track state records, 68 bytes, from `0x80005f60` |
| 96 | the track's 16-sample stereo block, `0x80003190 + 1024·ping + 128·track` 🟡 |
| 108 | `0x80000eb4 + 8·ping + track` |
| 112 | track 0..7 |
| 116 | the saved EMAC state |

Per-track state record `0x80005f60 + 68·track`; ring byte position at
`+0x3c` (`0x80005f9c + 68·track`), advancing 128 B per 16-sample stereo
frame 🟡 (his harness).

## 3. The seam a replacement can take (Jannik Aßfalg / repeat98, 22 Sep 2026)

From his note of 22 Sep 2026, written beside Tape Echo (PR #357: the effect runs on the ColdFire inside this routine,
in the stock delay's own ring for the track; the DSP side is a 5-word
passthrough). The practice half of the note is `MODULES.md` "Pricing a
ColdFire module".

```text
0x400031a0  complete eight-track frame routine
     ...    ring address calculation, DMA read and wait
     ...    prefetch of the next track
0x4000361a  replaceable per-track filter/mix seam
0x40003624  displaced stock filter/mix path
     ...
0x4000377a  common continuation into ring DMA commit and loop bookkeeping
```

✅ objdump: `0x4000361a` `moveal 92(%sp),%a5` / `movel 0x800000e8,%d0`,
then `0x40003624` `eoril #imm,%d0` (the scratch-buffer toggle; his hook
reads the immediate from `0x40003626` at run time) and `moveal
0x80006180,%a4` / `movem.l 20(%a4),...` (the per-track filter state).
Rejoin `0x4000377a`: `tst.l 112(%sp)`, a spin on `0xfc0450be` (DMA
status) and `0x800000e8` → `0xfc045080`: the ring DMA commit. Reset seam
`0x40002f44`: `lea -16(%sp)`, `movem.l d2-d5`, stock continuing at
`0x40002f4c` (his detour replays both).

🟡 Adopted on his complete-routine harness (the stock routine run from
`0x400031a0` over all eight tracks with a synchronous eDMA model, original
against patched image; audio, ring bytes, the 68-byte state records, ring
positions, both ping buffers and all four snapshots compared after every
frame):

- A hook that declines the custom path must replay the displaced loads
  exactly and leave every other integer and EMAC register as stock left
  it; a non-target id gets a byte-for-byte equivalent fallback.
- Omitting the `0x800000e8` toggle overwrites an in-flight DMA read for
  later tracks. `0x80006180` must advance by 68 per track.
- Ring samples are not held across callbacks. The rings are read through
  the uncached alias and DMA can replace history between frames; reusing
  a neighbouring sample within one frame, in a register, reloaded after a
  discontinuity, is the one safe form.
- The detour's own cost: 7,628 → 7,892 instructions per eight-track frame
  with every track on the stock path (+264, 3.5%).
- The eDMA model moves bytes synchronously: it proves addresses, lengths,
  ordering and resulting bytes; it cannot show arbitration, overlap,
  coherency or stalls.

## 4. Cost, and what is not measured

Per eight-track 16-sample frame under the port's instruction meter (his
`tools/verify/verify_tapeecho_cpu.py`, PR #357):

| case | instructions |
|---|---|
| stock DELAY ×8, original | 7,628 |
| stock DELAY ×8, hooked, every track stock | 7,892 |
| Tape Echo ×8, settled | ~23,000 |
| Tape Echo ×8, all controls moving | up to 32,355 |

Executed instructions, ColdFire, complete routine, not cycles: the meter
prices an uncached SDRAM access at one cycle and sees no cache, DMA stall
or scheduler. The frame period is 363 µs, ~95,800 cycles at 264 MHz,
shared with everything else the ColdFire runs. His unit freezes as Tape
Echo instances grow (`FAILURE_MODES.md`, "Freeze without an exception
screen as ColdFire delay-routine work grows"); those freezes are the only
bracket on the routine's budget.

## 5. Consequences for the bus

- The routine's input is the read-back after FX2 and its output re-enters
  on core 0, so it sits after every FX slot on every track. A bus send
  taps its slot, before the read-back: SEND substituted on id 8 on
  hardware gave "the reverb receives dry" (`DSP.md`). No slot sees the
  ColdFire delay's output.
- The rings are ColdFire SDRAM. The DSP's only link to them is the
  host-port DMA, 16-sample blocks each way once per frame: a DSP effect
  cannot use them for delay lines.
- A ColdFire effect prices in this routine's budget: BusVerb at ~18,000
  DSP cycles per frame and four-grain GRAIN at ~28,400 sit at or above the
  seven-instance freeze point, in the cheaper unit.
