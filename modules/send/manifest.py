"""SEND -- the bus client every other track runs: one SEND knob into the bus.

It taps the audio buffer and never writes it, so a SEND at SEND 0 is
indistinguishable from no effect; a fresh, unassigned track (FX2 id 0) is
aliased to it rather than to NONE because, unlike NONE, it performs the
per-block bus housekeeping, so no track can stall the bus.

Clones FILTER's descriptor. Slots 1-11 are blanked but keep FILTER's
defaults and value counts (not drawn; writing them would change bytes for
no reason). No formatter is declared, so the two knobs keep FILTER's
plain-numeric zeros (hardware-confirmed).
