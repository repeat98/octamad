"""TUNER -- a guitar-tuner readout of the current audio track: hold UP and
press TEMPO for a window with the note, octave, a +-50 cent needle and the
frequency, from the track's post-FX pre-fader audio, detected on the
ColdFire (McLeod NSDF + YIN refine, integer only) in the UI task. TEMPO,
YES, NO or the chord close it; TEMPO alone, FUNC + TEMPO and UP alone stay
stock.

Source: `upstream/` is Tim Hastie's repository (timhastie/octatrick-modules,
submodule, pinned to v2.9 (525f4b1) = Octatrick 2.9, 29 Sep 2026; the test builds 2.3 .. 2.8 and the 2.9
line up to its previous build flashed on his MKI, the last two 2.9 fixes
emulator-verified). The declaration is
`upstream/tuner/manifest.py`: one DRAM unit (`tuner.s`, `Linked(dram=True)`,
in the platform reserve with the other DRAM modules) and three detours (the
TEMPO opener's first instruction, frame_isr's tail, the UI task's loop
head); no ROM cave, no pokes. Its source paths are derived from its own
directory, so it is executed here from the source on disk, as the registry
does for every manifest, and this file only re-exports its MODULE. Nothing
inside `upstream/` is edited here.

Emulator-verified (26 Sep 2026 in Tim's tree; here in remix octatrick,
29 Sep 2026); not confirmed on hardware.
