# `synth` — SYNTH MACHINE

A two-operator FM synth machine for FLEX tracks, built from
[timhastie/octatrick-modules](https://github.com/timhastie/octatrick-modules)
(submodule `upstream/`, pinned to `v2.9` (`525f4b1`)). `Kind.CF_PATCH`: the voice engine as
a DRAM unit (`poly.s`), the page code as a pinned ROM cave (`page.s`; the
page descriptor itself is cloned from the unit's own ROM at first use, so no
stock bytes ship in the repo), a `SymbolRef` on the kind table's FLEX
renderer entry (and the STATIC entry, for the sample-track glide), detours
and pokes. No DSP code, no FX2 row. Since 2.9 the engine owns the AMP
envelope of a synth track and there is no peak limiter.

Any FLEX track whose sample is named FMSYNTH*.wav becomes a synth (a
silent 4 s marker file will do; SYNTH*.wav is still accepted, and the
marker's length never ends the note): the DSP shapes and effects the voice
as a sample. Its PLAYBACK page reads PTCH RATO INDX FINE FDBK DEC (title FM
SYNTH; PTCH in semitones, FINE in cents); on the LFO page VOIC (1 = mono,
2..4 = paraphonic) and CHRD (32 chord shapes in Syntakt order, each with
three inversions on the knob, lockable per step, snapped onto SCALE
QUANTIZER's scale); GLIDE from the quantizer's row. Since 2.8: MIDI IN
plays a synth track like the CHROMATIC keys (one voice a note up to VOIC, a
note-off releases it); a chord fingered on the keys or over MIDI during live
recording is recorded as PTCH / CHRD / VOIC locks (the bass, the shape and
its inversion, the voices heard; keys within a rolling 150 ms join, a
legato hand-over records single notes); LEG on every audio track's AMP
SETUP page (OFF / MONO on a sample track, OFF / MONO / POLY on a synth
track) is the legato switch, GLIDE the slide time, and a FLEX or STATIC
track with LEG MONO slides every pitch change over GLIDE; in GRID
RECORDING a held trig + FUNC + DOWN / UP moves its PTCH lock an octave.
Since 2.9: the engine owns the AMP envelope -- ATK / HOLD / REL are read
from the AMP page (locks, scenes and LFOs included) and applied in the
engine with the DSP's own laws, the DSP seeing an always-open envelope, so
a voice is never cut: a re-press continues the sounding oscillator from its
level, a faded note starts from silence over 16 frames, a release is at
least 1 ms, stealing and VOIC hand-overs fade, STOP kills at the stock
voice kill; the peak limiter is gone (the 1/sqrt(VOIC) level law stays, a
4-note chord about -10 dBFS); FINE reads 0c the moment a track becomes a
synth track (a file-browser load into a new project included); a sequencer
trig on a still-sounding note is delivered in the panel key's form
(`po_retrig`) so the DSP keeps its voice; a warm START ramps the FM index
envelope over 16 frames; chords snap onto SCALE QUANTIZER's root. Known
limit: a MACHINE change while a REL INF note sounds leaves it sounding
until the next key. `upstream/synth/README.md` is the full description
(the five phases, the voice model, what was measured and what was
inferred).

## Measured

- At `v9.1`, remixes `octatrick` and `octatrick-usb` built byte-identical
  with the module sources as a plain `modules/<name>/` directory and as this
  wrapper over the submodule (same base, same build reports), and
  byte-identical to the OCTATRICK9 images Tim flashed (built on
  upstream `0e93543`; upstream's changes since touch modules these
  remixes do not carry).
- The 2.8 features (MIDI IN, chord recording with inversions, the LEG
  modes, the sample-track glide, step transpose, the chord order) and the
  2.9 engine (the envelope laws against the DSP's, the START rule, the
  fades, STOP, `po_retrig`, the index ramp: the step / slope and |d2|
  figures) were each measured in the port through the virtual panel; the
  tables are in `upstream/synth/README.md`, per feature, with what is open.
- Cost against 2.8 (a static count of the FM loops): +6 instructions a
  sample a voice with the limiter's per-sample stage gone, about +15-20 %
  of a VOIC 1 synth track's frame work, ~0.1-0.2 % of the frame budget; the
  platform reserve and FREE MEM unchanged; the OS image's ROM section about
  3 KB smaller (the quantizer's move), the DRAM append a few KB larger.

## On the unit

- 26 Sep 2026: `OCTATRICK9` (remix `octatrick-usb`) on Tim's Octatrack
  MKI: the synth, the quantizer and direct jump, and USB audio on all 20
  channels on the MKI.
- Every test build since, 2.3 .. 2.8, flashed on the same MKI from Tim's
  own tree ([timhastie/octatrick](https://github.com/timhastie/octatrick),
  the same wrappers over the same submodule), and the 2.9 line up to the
  build before its last two fixes: ROOT, the DRAM quantizer, FINE 0c, the
  envelope engine and the limiter's removal ran on the MKI (the held-chord
  crackle gone, the live-key pops gone, by ear). The last two fixes (the
  sequencer trigs, the index ramp) are emulator-verified on `octatrick`
  (`make check` on this tree), not yet flashed.

## How it is built

Source: `upstream/` is Tim's repository (submodule, pinned to `v2.9` (`525f4b1`)).
Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here. The manifest here
(`manifest.py`) executes `upstream/synth/manifest.py` from the source on
disk and re-exports its `MODULE`; that manifest derives its source paths
from its own directory, so the same file builds at `modules/synth/` in
Tim's tree and at `modules/synth/upstream/synth/` here. The engine is
`Linked(dram=True)`: linked into the platform runtime with the other DRAM
units and depacked at boot into the arena reserve
(`docs/contributing/PLACEMENT.md`). The page is pinned at `0x400d24d0`, the
start of the second free gap.

## Collisions

`tempo-bus` also uses the second free gap, so the ledger refuses that pair.
The engine shares the platform reserve with the other DRAM modules (USB
MIDI, USB AUDIO, MIDI SCENES) inside one runtime.

## Updating

Bump the submodule pin and rebuild; the pinned page bytes and the engine's
reads of SCALE QUANTIZER's pinned addresses either hold or the build
refuses.
